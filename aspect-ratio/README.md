Hi! Welcome to your technical coding exam.

You're presented with a dropdown with some aspect ratios and a React Three Fiber canvas with a div inside. Your job is to:

1. Make the div respond to the aspect ratios of the dropdown.
2. Make the bottom right corner resize the div
3. Make it so that pressing shift while dragging the bottom right corner will make the div retain the same aspect ratio as how it started
